### Hi 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working as a back-end developer with Ruby [![Ruby](https://cdn.emojidex.com/emoji/mdpi/Ruby.png "Ruby")](https://www.ruby-lang.org)
- 🌱 I occasionally learn Python 🐍
- ☕️ I mainly drink coffee by day & beers by night 🍻


### And now, here is a lil' snake who will happily eat my hard work of the year
